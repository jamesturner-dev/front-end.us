#### I'm not quite ready to write a backend in Go, but I'm getting there. 

That being said I recognize that I need to create a backend for my day to day use.  

This Node / Express / MongoDb framework that I created is really good, so I am going to use it for my own devices.  First of which is a secure, encrypted online file manager.  Sure there are plenty of third party services I could use but I do not want to use them, I want to use the one that I create, host, maintain, etc.

So I am going to back up a bit and write this backend using Node.  Will I re-write it in Go?  Time will tell.
